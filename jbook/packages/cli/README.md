# JBOOK

---

This is an interactive coding enviroment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

- CLick any text cell (including this one) to edit it
- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!
- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling `show` function. This is a function build into this enviroment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values.
- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right.
- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell.

All of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with. So if you ran `npx jsnote-nemo serve book.js`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the book.js file.
